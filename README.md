An Electric company has developed a software to update the city-wise grid status in the central
database per hour. Each city is divided into 24 areas or grid stations. After every hour, the software
running at the city level, will verify the status of each grid station either if it is Active or In-Active.
Your task is to write a code which can store the statuses of each of the 24 grids by using least
possible memory.
Note: An input file named "Q1Input.txt" will contain statuses of each grid in the following format:
G1,Active
G2,Inactive
.

.
G24,Active
